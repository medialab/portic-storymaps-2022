<div id="part-2"><p>As Dunkirk and more generally the Flemish and Picardy ports were close to Britain, they were naturally privileged trading partners. Trade with the British Isles therefore accounted for a significant proportion of these provinces’ maritime traffic – around a third in the case of Flanders –, compared with a much smaller percentage for the rest of the Atlantic seaboard.</p><p>This trade with the English "enemy" was difficult and unpredictable, but it was significant for the ports of these provinces, and for Dunkirk in particular. As we shall see, it was also a particular kind of trade. Because of the very high import taxes on certain products – notably French spirits, fabrics, tobacco and, until 1784, tea –, many English captains specialized in smuggling these goods into their country, a practice that contemporaries referred to as "smogglage"<dfn data-effect="solid" data-for="contents-tooltip" data-tip=" Derived from the Dutch smokklaar, a fraudster.">?</dfn>. </p><h2 id="h.3rdcrjn">1. The British at Dunkirk, between legal shipping and smuggling</h2><p><Caller id="destinations-gb-vers-gb"></Caller></p><p>Smuggling from Dunkirk to Britain was predominant, as shown on the map opposite, which details the number of departures of British ships from Dunkirk to Britain in 1787. The destinations shown in red are those where the trade was legal and accurately declared to the French authorities. For the most part, these were trips to Sunderland (a coal-exporting port, whence the ships returned empty) or to London, in which case they were medium to large vessels (more than half were 100-150-ton ships) mostly exporting spirits and various other goods. The majority of clearances, however, were issued for false destinations, to ships that were smuggling. </p><p><Caller id="stigmates-smoggleurs-dunkerque"></Caller></p><p>There can be no doubt about the nature of the fraudsters’ clearances. Between seven and eight out of ten clearances issued to British ships in 1787 and 1789 were issued to captains officially bound for "Lisbon" or, to a lesser extent, "Bergen". However, the same ships with the same captain took another clearance in Dunkirk three or four days later, which would be impossible if they had indeed travelled to those distant destinations. Moreover, all these ships had the same tonnage – 12 tons – which confirms the purely conventional nature of their declarations. These ships were in fact coasters engaged in cross-Channel smuggling. The clerk of the Admiralty issued them with clearances showing false destinations and tonnage, and indicating that they were leaving empty, which was also false. This enabled the crew to claim to British customs cruisers that they were on their way to a foreign port, and to be empty if they were too close to the coast for the disguise to be credible (in which case they would throw their cargo overboard if they were caught).</p><p>We additionally have lists of this same traffic, also drawn up by the Admiralty, which specify the cargoes of these ships, explicitly referred to as "smoggleurs", for several years (in particular 1787 and 1791). A comparison of French and British sources furthermore confirms that they were indeed smuggling. The <a className="c23" href="https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C307785">English Customs Service</a> reported 169 entries into English ports between 5 January 1789 and 5 January 1790 (a total of 18,153 tons<dfn data-effect="solid" data-for="contents-tooltip" data-tip=" The British and the French did not use quite the same units of measurement and the same criteria for measuring ships.">?</dfn>) by British-flagged ships from "French Flanders"<dfn data-effect="solid" data-for="contents-tooltip" data-tip=" The «French Flanders» category included the ports of Dunkirk and Gravelines. However, only two ships sailed from Gravelines for England in 1789, both under the British flag: one to Sunderland (80 tonneaux) and the other to Padstow (50 tonneaux). ">?</dfn>, whereas in 1789 Dunkirk issued 1,361 clearances to Great Britain, 956 of which were simulated destinations (Lisbon or Bergen). Moreover, British sources do not mention any tobacco imports from French Flanders, for example, whereas French sources indicate that the smoggleurs had some on board.</p><p>This trade was illegal from the British point of view, but it was even openly encouraged by the French authorities, who saw it as an excellent opportunity to improve France’s balance of trade. Inspector Chardon, who was sent on a tour of all the French admiralty offices, expressed his delight when visiting Dunkirk in 1782: "this trade makes England dependent on France for five to six million a year".</p><p>Smuggling was not peculiar to Dunkirk, nor due to its free port. We know that the activity of ships sailing from France to Britain to smuggle goods was intense all along the coast of the Channel because it was so close to England. In the following section we consider the smuggling from Dunkirk in the more general context of French Atlantic ports.</p><h2 id="h.26in1rg">2. Smuggling and the main French ports concerned</h2><p><Caller id="gravure-smoggleurs"></Caller></p><p>Eighteenth-century European states had active trade policies to improve their balance of trade, encourage the development of their colonies and shipping, and meet their financial needs.<dfn data-effect="solid" data-for="contents-tooltip" data-tip=" The balance of trade measures the difference between the respective values of imports and exports.">?</dfn> These policies sometimes involved prohibitions or dissuasive import duties, particularly in the case of France and Great Britain, both of which had a very dense customs network. England had a particularly aggressive trade policy towards France, as part of its struggle to control world trade. The British state derived a significant proportion of its revenue from various import and consumption taxes. These prohibitions and dissuasive duties strongly motivated attempts to circumvent them, to take advantage of the price difference between the domestic market and foreign suppliers.</p><p>Smuggling accounted for thousands of crossings of the English Channel every year. The boats, often of very small tonnage, unloaded their cargoes in sheltered coves on the English coast, sometimes at night, or dropped them close to the coast before entering their port of destination empty. All the smuggling was carried out by the British, as they alone had access to the smuggling networks for distributing the goods. These networks were extremely well organized. Once the cargo had been recovered, gangs of several dozen smugglers took the products to their destination – usually the London market. They benefited from the complicity of local administrative and judicial authorities, and had no qualms about confronting customs officials, if necessary. A vast English literature has studied this smuggling from the social and political points of view, but few researchers have focused on its economic dimensions.<dfn data-effect="solid" data-for="contents-tooltip" data-tip=" For an introduction, see Simon Harvey, Smuggling: Seven Centuries of Contraband, London: Reaktion Books, 2016, or François Crouzet, &quot;La contrebande entre la France et les Îles britanniques au XVIIIe siècle&quot;, in: Fraude, contrefaçon et contrebande.

First, not every ship that left a French port bound for the British Isles was smuggling, and secondly, they were not always properly recorded by the port authorities. In the years 1781-1785, Inspector Chardon’s informants mentioned the existence of smugglers in Brest, Fécamp, Dunkirk, Boulogne and Roscoff. But during his personal visit to the Admiralty in Brest, Inspector Chardon noted that the English smoggleurs, "like those of Dunkirk", did not report to the Admiralty.</p><p>We examined and cross-referenced French sources from the Admiralty (clearances) and from the Ferme Générale (balance of trade) for eleven ports: Bordeaux, Boulogne-sur-Mer, Calais, Dieppe, Fécamp, Lorient, Roscoff, Saint-Malo and three Cotentin ports falling under the Cherbourg Ferme (Omonville, Diélette and Port-Bail). For each port, we sought to identify smuggling to England.<dfn data-effect="solid" data-for="contents-tooltip" data-tip=" In the Methodology section of this study we have detailed the procedure we followed to establish this assessment. Readers interested in this aspect are referred to it.">?</dfn> The analysis led us to exclude Dieppe, Fécamp and the three Cotentin ports where it did not seem possible to identify smugglers, and to retain only the six ports shown in the diagram opposite. We can now compare the extent of smuggling in the six ports selected on the basis of two criteria: shipping, and the value of goods smuggled to Britain.</p><p><Caller id="smoggleur-proportion"></Caller></p><p>As far as shipping is concerned, the ports of Boulogne-sur-Mer, Dunkirk and Calais recorded by far the most departures of smoggleurs, which accounted for the vast majority of British ships leaving these three ports. Only Dunkirk was frequented by any significant British non-smuggling traffic. The other three ports (Bordeaux, Lorient and Roscoff), which were further from the British coast, had much less traffic to this destination. Of these, Roscoff had a similar proportion of smoggleurs to Dunkirk (around 80%). While in Lorient approximately every second departure of a British ship, on average, was a smoggleur, in Bordeaux smuggling was a very marginal activity for British ships.</p><p>In 1787, Dunkirk had the second highest number of smoggleurs leaving its port, but the third highest if we consider their cumulative tonnage. However, as we saw in the first section, we know that the indication of tonnages in Dunkirk was inaccurate, as the clerk systematically noted 12 tons.</p><p>To measure Dunkirk’s role in smuggling more accurately, we need to be able to compare the values traded. For the year 1789 (and only for that year), this is not too difficult for ports other than Dunkirk, as the sources of the Ferme Générale indicate the value of exports to the British Isles (systematically referred to in the sources as "England"). These values include smuggling, as well as legal exports from the English point of view. They therefore overestimate the value of smuggling. For ports where the bulk of shipping was involved in smuggling, these data allow a comparison with Dunkirk. Exports from France could also be made on French ships, but the number of those going there  was very limited in 1787. Exports from Boulogne to the British Isles in 1789 – all flags combined – totalled 1.9 million livres tournois. Exports from Calais totalled 1.1 million livres tournois.</p><p>Unfortunately, the same method cannot be used for Dunkirk because of its status as a free port.<dfn data-effect="solid" data-for="contents-tooltip" data-tip=" For 1789, the data of the Dunkirk Ferme do not include exports from the free port.">?</dfn> We have an estimate made by Inspector Chardon in the early 1780s, but duties on tea imports changed in the middle of the decade. During his visit to the Admiralty of Dunkirk in 1782, Chardon mentioned, regarding trade with England, the departure every year of "1,000 to 1,200 fraudulent ships, attracted to Dunkirk by the ease that its franchise affords them to match their purchases with all sorts of goods". As 1782 was a war year, Chardon was no doubt referring to the situation before the conflict, as the number of smugglers recorded by Christian Pfister in 1782 was around half that mentioned by the inspector.</p><p>Here is the nature and value of this annual trade (in a peace year before the war) according to Chardon:</p><p>1) 500,000 jars of brandy at 25 sous (1.25 livres tournois) for a total of 625,000 livres tournois</p><p>2) coffee from the French colonies, fabrics from Lyon and Rouen, cloth, wine, tobacco, tea and goods from India, for around 5 million livres tournois; </p><p>3) Cambric and other fashion items amounting to 1.5 million. </p><p>The inspector compared this contraband (totalling 7,125,000 livres tournois) with the 1.8 million in legal trade with the British Isles, consisting of brandy (800,000 jars) and indigo. This figure is interesting, but we have no equivalent for the other Channel ports, so it is not possible to draw a comparison. Moreover, it is probably not transposable to 1789, as tea smuggling to Great Britain collapsed after 1784.</p><p>To estimate the value of smuggled goods leaving the Flemish port, we therefore had to rely on documents from the period and to make an estimate. </p><p>Fortunately, we have data on smoggleur cargoes for 1787, a year of peace quite close to 1789, which came after the reform of tea duties in Great Britain. Although the Admiralty’s clearance registers officially show all smoggleurs sailing in ballast that year, the same administration compiled a specific monthly list of smoggleurs, which was kept for ten months. These lists indicated the products and quantities transported by each smoggleur. To determine their value, we used the average prices in the Toflit database for 1789.<dfn data-effect="solid" data-for="contents-tooltip" data-tip=" Further details are provided in the Methodology section.">?</dfn> The graph opposite shows the estimated value by type of product, as well as the unit of measurement in which the quantities are expressed in the source document. By selecting from the menu on the right, it is possible to quantify the number of cases from which the average price could be calculated.</p><p><Caller id="prix-smogglage-general"></Caller></p><p>Using this approximate method, we estimate the value of goods smuggled from Dunkirk to Great Britain in 1787 at 3.3 million livres tournois. This is more than 50% down on the figures given by Inspector Chardon in 1782 for the pre-war years. As the estimated value of smuggling from Calais and Boulogne was 3 million livres tournois, this means that Dunkirk was the main player in smuggling to Britain, but that it controlled only about half the smuggling trade. </p><p>Although the values involved are considerable for the local players concerned, it should be remembered that in 1789, smuggling to Britain accounted for only 0.75% of all French exports (which totalled around 445 million livres tournois). Even for Dunkirk, whose imports totalled 43 million, the value of smuggling should be put into perspective.</p><p>3. Composition and evolution of smuggling</p><p>Estimates of the value of smuggling from Dunkirk in 1787 provide us with some interesting information about its composition. Three product groups alone account for 96% of the value of smuggled goods: fabrics (estimated annual value of 1.4 million livres tournois, 42% of the total), alcoholic beverages (1.29 million livres tournois, 39% of the total) and various types of tobacco (0.5 million livres tournois, 15% of the total). The main products were brandy, silk handkerchiefs, and leaf tobacco, while the value of tea, the main smuggled product before the British customs reform of 1785, was negligible (around 17,000 livres tournois).</p><p>We do have the quantities and values of products exported in 1789 from other parts of France to the free port of Dunkirk (the total value was 8.6 million livres tournois). In light of these figures, it would seem, for example, that the tobacco smuggled to England was mainly of foreign origin (Dutch or North American), while the spirits were more likely to be French, or produced in Dunkirk distilleries. The case of textiles is interesting. Most of the fabrics smuggled to England were Asian: nankins, muslins, bandanas, silk handkerchiefs, etc. The fabrics imported into Dunkirk from other parts of France were however of a different kind, mainly cotton, hemp and linen. This leaves us with two possibilities: either Dunkirk obtained its supplies illegally from Lorient, or the free port smuggled in products from other European East India companies and then exported them to British markets. The second hypothesis is compatible with Dunkirk’s role as a staple port for European goods. It seems likely that, generally speaking, the smuggling to and from Dunkirk was not a way of bringing French products into Britain, as most of the smuggled goods did not come from France. </p><p><Caller id="carte-homeport-smoggleurs"></Caller></p><p>We have tried to understand whether the situation in the last years of the Ancien Régime was any different from that in previous years. The lower part of the graph opposite shows the evolution of smuggling in Dunkirk over time. Unfortunately, we only have incomplete data for the 1780s. The years 1781 and 1782 were war years, and it was illegal to trade with Great Britain. Our histogram shows that this was not the case, however. In wartime, the French military authorities wanted to eliminate smuggling networks for fear of enemy espionage. Conversely, the local authorities fiercely defended smuggling, as the town’s economy and finances benefited so much from this activity. In 1778, at the beginning of the American War of Independence, the burgomaster testified that the ministerial orders allowing "in the present circumstances the English smuggling ships known as smoggleurs to continue their trade, have spread universal joy among our inhabitants". </p><p>While the data for 1781 and 1782 show that some smuggling activity continued, we are unable to measure the impact of the British tea duty reforms of 1784. What the chart does show is a resumption of smuggling networks between 1785 and 1787. In view of Inspector Chardon’s estimates (for an average year before the war, and more than double the value we estimate for 1789), and the values we have estimated for the pre-revolutionary period, the decrease in smuggling in the early 1780s seems to have been very steep. In 1789, therefore, we observe a declining activity which in any case was never a decisive asset for the penetration of the British market by French producers.</p><h2 id="h.35nkun2">4. Presumed destinations of smuggling</h2><p>The type of products loaded by the British smoggleurs raises the question of the markets that absorbed them. As the Dunkirk clearance registers do not specify the actual destination of the smuggler ships, we have considered their home port as an approximation of their destination. This assumption is all the more likely given that smuggling relied on local networks which, once the goods had been recovered from the ships, transported them overland to their final market. The map shows the home ports of the smoggleurs to which a clearance was issued in Dunkirk between 1781 and 1790. If one hovers over the map or the corresponding place name in the margin, the trend in the number of clearances over the decade, by home port, appears in the lower part of the image. </p><p>Despite the diffuse nature of smuggling, the concentration of smugglers in the south-east quarter of England, particularly around the Thames estuary, bears witness to the attraction of the London market. Elsewhere, smuggling was much more sporadic. </p><p>We believe that the variations in annual smuggling activity in each port reflect the presence, to a greater or lesser degree, of British coastguard patrols. Their impact is smoothed by aggregating the data by year, and would probably be more visible with a more detailed analysis on a weekly basis.</p><p><Caller id="exports-vs-smogglage"></Caller></p><p>We also explored the possible existence of local specialization in terms of products. By choosing to display the number of journeys in 1787, or the value we had estimated of the products smuggled, we were able to detect some differences. Cargoes imported at Deal, for example, were worth less than those imported at Hastings or Folkestone. By clicking on each port, we can see the composition of the cargoes and display the estimated values for each product category. Hastings and Folkestone imported tobacco mainly (45% and 56% of the total, respectively), which was worth more than the spirits and liqueurs that made up the bulk of other smuggled imports, while in Deal, tobacco accounted for only 15% of the total. The data from Dunkirk do not allow us to say more, as a full understanding of these phenomena would require the use of British sources.</p></div>
