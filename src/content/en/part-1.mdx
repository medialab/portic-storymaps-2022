Four years later, in <Caller className="is-inblock" id="histoire-dunkerque" year="1662">1662</Caller>, Louis XIV bought this town of around 5,000 inhabitants from Charles II for 5 million livres tournois. Although Dunkirk had long enjoyed the privileges associated with its status as a Flemish town, the French government granted it major tax exemptions and complete port freedom. This status lasted until 1792, owing above all to the active vigilance of its merchant elites, united within the Chamber of Commerce founded in <Caller className="is-inblock" id="histoire-dunkerque" year="1700">1700</Caller>.</p><p>This section looks at this complex institutional framework, for it played an important role in the development of Dunkirk’s shipping, and at the nature of the sources from which to document the port’s activity.

A French port and its institutions</h2><p><Caller id="histoire-dunkerque" year="1700"></Caller></p><p>The fiscal effort made by Louis XIV to acquire Dunkirk was aimed at developing this important maritime and military outpost with a view to using it against his enemies: England and Holland. The Spanish crown had obtained huge sums of money from the privateering war waged from the Flemish port since 1580: 23 million florins at the expense of Dutch merchants, between 1626 and 1648, that is, 46 million livres tournois.<dfn data-effect="solid" data-for="contents-tooltip" data-tip=" This was a considerable sum.

In addition to its free port, the town’s other major privilege concerned its sailors who were registered with the Dunkirk bureau des classes<dfn data-effect="solid" data-for="contents-tooltip" data-tip=" The classes system was a form of lifelong conscription for seafarers in France and for inland navigation personnel: they were in the service of the state every third or fourth year.

They could therefore continue to sail as privateers in wartime. The town prospered in the early 18th century, and its population more than doubled, to 14,000.</p><p><Caller displayassises="" id="histoire-dunkerque" year="1713"></Caller></p><p>The importance of Dunkirk as a privateer port is also evidenced by the fact that as early as <Caller className="is-inblock" id="histoire-dunkerque" year="1706">1706</Caller> the English and Dutch demanded the dismantling of the fortifications and the filling in of the port during negotiations to end the Spanish War of Succession. The clause was moreover incorporated into the Peace Treaty of Utrecht signed in <Caller className="is-inblock" id="histoire-dunkerque" year="1713">1713</Caller>. Dunkirk suffered greatly from this destruction, and by the early 1720s it had a population of just 10-11,000. The city’s customs boundaries were redefined, and revenues from the assise, the tax on the consumption of alcohol, likewise declined steeply, falling to half its former level between the turn of the century and the decade 1716-1724 [Pfister, 2015].</p><p><Caller id="evolution-budget-dunkerque"></Caller></p><p>Maritime traffic picked up again between the 1720s and the 1750s, boosting municipal revenues and more than doubling the town’s budget. There was a revenue surplus in the 1730s, and the increase in expenditure during the Austrian War of Succession (1740-1748) seems to have been absorbed without too much difficulty. The Seven Years War (1756-1763), on the other hand, led to a doubling of expenditure, which continued for several years after the end of the conflict, and revenue was unable to keep apace. The American War of Independence (1778-1783) led to an even further escalation of expenditures, but this time the deficit was kept under control. All in all, municipal revenues increased almost tenfold between 1726 and 1783. This spectacular rise was owing to the city’s commercial and demographic growth, which was closely linked to that of the port. </p><p><Caller id="histoire-dunkerque" year="1731"></Caller></p><p>The resumption of navigation followed the collapse in 1720 of the cofferdam<dfn data-effect="solid" data-for="contents-tooltip" data-tip=" Temporary dam (sometimes dyke or enclosure) built on the bed of a watercourse.">?</dfn> put in place following the Treaty of Utrecht. The channel was cleared, and by 1730 the port was once again accessible. Although the largest ships were still obliged to unload in the roadstead, by 1731 a warehouse had to be built to accommodate the influx of colonial goods. The port was completely rebuilt from 1744 onwards, but was demolished again in 1748, at the end of the Austrian War of Succession. The scenario was repeated during the Seven Years War, and the port was destroyed for a third time in 1763. The port infrastructure was not fully operational again until 1790, on the eve of another war.</p><p>These vicissitudes did not prevent maritime traffic from growing steadily during the second half of the 18th century. The construction in <Caller className="is-inblock" id="histoire-dunkerque" year="1750">1750</Caller> of a new building, opposite the Town Hall, to house the Chamber of Commerce (and then the Stock Exchange, created in 1754), bears witness to the growing power of the institutions responsible for defending the town’s trade and maintaining its franchises. </p><p>Dunkirk’s exemption from customs duties applied to the entire port and town until <Caller className="is-inblock" id="histoire-dunkerque" year="1713">1713</Caller>. From then on, the Lower Town was reintegrated into the kingdom’s customs area. The barriers were therefore transferred to the gates of the Upper Town, guarded by the employees of the Ferme<dfn data-effect="solid" data-for="contents-tooltip" data-tip=" Created in 1680, the Ferme Générale was responsible for collecting a range of taxes, in particular customs taxes known as traites.

Its creation had deprived the municipality’s merchant elite of some of its ancient maritime and commercial prerogatives, which was the source of a recurrent conflict between the Chamber of Commerce and the Admiralty throughout the 18th century. The Admiralty had legal control over the port area and specifically over wartime privateering. It also had control over the piloting service, recreated in <Caller className="is-inblock" id="histoire-dunkerque" year="1729">1729</Caller> to ensure the safety of exit from and entrance to the Dunkirk harbour and to the roadstead which was dangerous due to the presence of sandbanks. This non-compulsory service was increasingly used by ships’ captains from Dunkirk and elsewhere. </p><p><Caller id="histoire-dunkerque" year="1786"></Caller></p><p>The negotiation and signing of the Treaty of Eden between France and Great Britain (1786) gave rise to a major debate about the fiscal status of the port of Dunkirk. Some even called for its abolition. Britain feared that, in the absence of a Ferme office to monitor the entry of goods into the free port, Dunkirk could pass off foreign products as English when they were brought into France. </p><p>Built in the Lower Town in 1784-85, the new Hôtel des Fermes was unable to record and account for goods arriving by sea. To overcome this difficulty, the Admiralty agreed to provide the Balance of Trade Office with monthly statistical reports on goods entering the port. The Dunkirk merchants accepted this constraint in exchange for maintaining their privileges. </p><p><Caller id="schema-sources"></Caller></p><p>At the end of the Ancien Régime, there were four very different ways of measuring trade in and out of the free port of Dunkirk: </p><ol><li>Clearances (congés<dfn data-effect="solid" data-for="contents-tooltip" data-tip=" The congé was a legal document that any ship leaving a French port had to obtain.

However, smuggling was not measured by the British, whereas the Admiralty at Dunkirk drew up lists of smugglers’ departures.</p><h2 id="h.3dy6vkm">2. The development of shipping in Dunkirk in the 18th century</h2><p><Caller id="evolution-type-conges"></Caller></p><p>On the eve of the French Revolution, Dunkirk was one of the kingdom’s main harbours. In terms of the number of clearances issued between 1787 and 1789, it was the second busiest port of mainland France, behind Marseilles but ahead of Bordeaux. Dunkirk even ranked first for foreign ship departures. However, the number of clearances is an approximate indicator of port activity, as it adds up ships of all sizes. If we compare the French ports in terms of tonneaux rather than ships, the picture is different: in 1787, Bordeaux shipped a total of 265,000 tonneaux<dfn data-effect="solid" data-for="contents-tooltip" data-tip=" The tonneau de mer is a French unit of volume corresponding to 1.44 cubic metres. We use the abbreviation tx and the plural tonneaux.">?</dfn>, Le Havre 212,000, Nantes 142,000, Rouen 122,000, and Dunkirk 105,000 (we do not have data for Marseilles). Although the figure for Dunkirk is probably an underestimate, since the Admiralty assigned a conventional and very low volume of 12 tonneaux to British smuggling vessels leaving the Flemish port (see below)<dfn data-effect="solid" data-for="contents-tooltip" data-tip=" In a later document, the French authorities openly acknowledged this underestimation: «On 1 March 1791, as there were large and small smuggler boats, a distinction was made. All open boats from 1 to 40 tx, without being measured, were recorded under the 12-tx port [...]. Large ships of 41 tx and above were recorded under the 20-tx port [...]». Archives Nationales de France, Marine, C/4/238, f° 248-249.">?</dfn>, it should be remembered that Dunkirk’s maritime traffic ranked about the same as that of Nantes or La Rochelle, and was exceeded only by the Bordeaux - Marseille - Rouen/Le Havre trio.</p><p>The annual reports on clearances<dfn data-effect="solid" data-for="contents-tooltip" data-tip=" The reports were used to verify the revenue collected and summarized the number of clearances issued by the Admiralty offices. ">?</dfn> (see opposite) reveal the characteristics of shipping in Dunkirk after the end of the Seven Years War. The clerk of the Admiralty distinguished between the total number of clearances issued, firstly by flag (French or foreign), which determined the taxes. He then counted them by category: "cabotage"<dfn data-effect="solid" data-for="contents-tooltip" data-tip=" In this context, the term referred to all shipping to European ports between the North Sea and the Straits of Gibraltar.">?</dfn>, "long distance"<dfn data-effect="solid" data-for="contents-tooltip" data-tip=" The term referred to all trans-oceanic shipping and all departures towards the Baltic Sea or the Mediterranean.">?</dfn> and, for French ships, "Islands"<dfn data-effect="solid" data-for="contents-tooltip" data-tip=" The concept mainly covered trade with the West Indies, although the category also included trade with the Mascarene Islands and the slave trade.">?</dfn>, "guerre et marchandises" (literarily: "war and goods", meaning cargo connected to privateering)<dfn data-effect="solid" data-for="contents-tooltip" data-tip=" The term referred to an armed merchant ship with the ability to capture enemy vessels during its voyage, should the opportunity arise.

In years when France and Great Britain were at peace, foreign shipping consisted mainly of cross-Channel traffic operated by English smugglers (see Section II). </p><p><Caller id="pilotage" methodo_uniquement=""></Caller></p><p>The sources that we have for assessing shipping in the port of Dunkirk are very incomplete, not only because of Dunkirk’s status as a free port, but also because of the extensive destruction that occurred from the 18th century onwards. Reports exist only for the years from 1765 to 1792. For the earlier period there are piloting registers, but as some of the captains did not use a pilot to enter or leave the port of Dunkirk, this source does not account for all the ships entering and leaving the port. However, as we have both sources for some thirty years, we can measure the average proportion of ships using pilots to leave the port, and the variability of this proportion from year to year. On average, 41% of ships leaving port between 1763 and 1792 used a pilot. In some years, this proportion was higher. For example, as we can see on the lower part of the graph opposite: in 1775 the proportion was 72% higher than the average, as 70% of ships (and not 41% as is the case on average) used a pilot. Conversely, in 1763 and 1791 it was 30% below average, as 28% of ships used a pilot.</p><p><Caller id="pilotage"></Caller></p><p>For the period 1730-1763, we have only piloting registers. Therefore, to estimate the number of ships that left Dunkirk during this period, we assume that the average number of ships using a pilot, calculated for the period 1765-1792, also applies to the previous period. In addition, we know that this proportion was subject to fluctuations, so that from one year to the next, the proportion recorded was between 30% and +70%. These calculations enable us to extrapolate an estimate of the number of ships leaving Dunkirk in the period 1730-1764, in the form of a range.</p><p>Despite the uncertainties associated with the lack of data, this exercise does reveal some real trends. Traffic was clearly on the rise until the outbreak of the American War of Independence (1778). However, the trend was not linear: maritime conflicts reduced port activity substantially. The impact of the Austrian Wars Succession (1744-1748), the Seven Years War (1756-1763) and the American War of Independence (1778-1783) on shipping is evident. The recovery began as soon as peace was restored, but it was slower and less marked in the 1780s than after previous wars.</p><p><Caller id="pilotage" resultat_uniquement=""></Caller></p><p>The growth observed from the 1730s onwards is consistent with that of Dunkirk’s population, which reached 27,000 on the eve of the French Revolution. </p><p><Caller id="evolution-type-conges"></Caller></p><p>The impact of wars at sea on the port’s traffic was not the same for the various components indicated above, as we can see here during the American War of Independence. The conflicts had a greater negative impact on French-flagged shipping than on foreign-flagged shipping; shipments to the colonies, fishing in Newfoundland and long-distance French shipping were all but wiped out. French cabotage in 1779 was down to 20% of its 1777 level. The only substitute activity that emerged was privateering and "guerre et marchandises". Foreign cabotage also fell, but to a lesser extent than French cabotage (the level in 1779 was 40% that of 1777), before partially recovering, owing primarily to the activity of neutrals. </p><p>When peace was restored in 1783, all sectors returned to pre-war levels, with the exception of foreign cabotage. This was probably due to the virtual cessation of tea smuggling to England following the British customs reform in 1784. </p><h2 id="h.1t3h5sf">3. Dunkirk shipping</h2><p><Caller id="homeports-from-dunkerque"></Caller></p><p>Not only was Dunkirk a node of intense shipping activity, it was also a major port for equipping ships. In 1789, 309 Dunkirk ships (totalling 28,593 tons) left the port. A significant proportion of Dunkirk’s shipping was therefore handled by local merchant shipowners. In 1787, the Dunkirk Admiralty issued 350 clearances, totalling 28,095 tons, to ships from the port. This accounted for 56% of all the French clearances issued in 1787 in the Flemish port. By way of comparison, the percentage of all French clearances that were issued to local ships was just 22% in Bordeaux (326 out of 1,476) and 27% in Nantes (307 out of 1,128). Dunkirk’s profile, similar to that of Saint-Malo (62% of French clearances were granted to local ships, i.e. 472 out of 754), therefore shows a high level of shipping activity. The 1787 and 1789 clearance registers and additional documentation from the Dunkirk Chamber of Commerce used by Christian Pfister allow us to analyse in greater depth the main maritime activities of the people of Dunkirk.</p><p>In times of war, Dunkirk traditionally armed itself for privateering. This activity declined sharply throughout the 18th century: the value of booties during the Austrian War of Succession (1744-1748) and the Seven Years War (1756-1763) was no more than half that of the Spanish War of Succession (1701-1713), when some 1,614 prizes fetched 30.5 million livres tournois. Although 1,200 prizes were sold to Dunkirk during the American War of Independence (1778-1783), for a total of 25 million, they were largely taken by American privateers. </p><p><Caller filtrespavillons="dunkerquois" id="carte-destinations" projection="World"></Caller></p><p>The map shows, in aggregate tonnage, the destinations stated on the clearances issued in Dunkirk to local ships. Authorized in 1721 to trade with the colonies, Dunkirk did not make this its main activity, and was therefore well behind the four main French ports that provided most of the links with the West Indies. In 1775, only 12 ships arriving from the West Indies entered Dunkirk, out of a total of 556 for the whole of France. Dunkirk was only the sixth largest French port, on a par with Saint-Malo. However, Saint-Malo imported larger quantities of sugar, coffee and cotton. The ability to import prohibited or heavily taxed products, particularly from English factories, for use in the slave or colonial trade did therefore not seem to have triggered a dynamic that might have given Dunkirk a considerable advantage. Although the port’s colonial trade increased after 1782, this did not change its position nationally during the reign of Louis XVI (1774-1792). With 20 straight shipments in 1787, Dunkirk shipped to the West Indies four times less than did Nantes or Le Havre, six times less than Marseille, and eleven times less than Bordeaux. Compared with other French ports, Dunkirk’s slave-trading activity was also limited: around sixty shipments over the whole of the eighteenth century. Dunkirk’s particularity in the colonial context was the scale of the shipments returning from Tobago. In 1788, half of the 14 ships from Tobago sailed to Dunkirk, and the other seven to Le Havre [Tarrade: 1973: 733]. This colony, lost by France to England at the end of the Seven Years War in 1763, was recovered in 1783. However, Tobago colonists’ main market was still London, owing to Dunkirk’s franchise.</p><p>Fishing, visible on the map through the presence of ships in Newfoundland, Iceland and the North Sea, was a traditional part of Dunkirk’s economy, which diversified during the 18th century. </p><p><Caller id="carte-peche"></Caller></p><p>Herring fishing was at the origin of the town’s foundation in the twelfth century; this fish is even on the town’s coat of arms. In the sixteenth century, Dunkirk became the leading Flemish fishing port, and in 1566 it fitted out 120 ships (busses). However, the sector quickly went into decline with the attacks by Gueux de mer (pirates)<dfn data-effect="solid" data-for="contents-tooltip" data-tip=" Dutch sailors who fled abroad after the Gueux revolt (1566) against Philip II of Spain, during the repression led by the Duke of Alba. At the end of the 1560s, some 80 privateers with letters of marque from William of Orange-Nassau were operating against the Spanish from French (La Rochelle) and English ports.">?</dfn> from 1572 onwards, which reduced the fleet by nine-tenths and forced Dunkirk to turn to privateering. When the port was destroyed in 1713-14, local herring fishing was at its lowest ebb, but had become the only viable activity. The number of boats had already doubled by 1730, to a total of 30, and sometimes exceeded 50 in the following decades. The traditional fishing grounds were located in the North Sea (between Dunkirk and the Dogger Bank). This type of fishing in sight of the coast gave Dunkirk’s sailors some breathing space. However, the Seven Years War, particularly the period from 1759 to 1762, brought this growth to a halt and a steady decline began in 1765, despite a few occasional upswings. By 1792, the fleet was back to its 1713 level.</p><p>The decline of herring fishing was nevertheless not the same as the decline of fishing in general. The accumulated capital was invested in other sectors and other fishing grounds: Iceland and Newfoundland for cod, the Shetland Islands which combined herring and cod, with vessels of between 30 and 60 tons, and Greenland and the southern hemisphere for whaling. While fishing around Newfoundland collapsed during the wars, due to the risk of capture by the English, fishing in Iceland increased, thanks to the neutrality of the ships that flew the imperial flag in Ostend. </p><p>On the eve of the French Revolution, Dunkirk was the third largest French port in terms of the number of cod fishing vessels, after Saint-Malo and Granville. In 1787, this fishery employed 75 cod ships with a total tonnage of over 5,000 tons. Unlike other French cod-fishing ports, Dunkirk vessels fished mainly around Iceland.</p><p>Fishing was therefore an important industry for Dunkirk’s inhabitants in the 18th century. In the 1750s, it is believed to have provided employment for some 2,000 people – if we include fishermen, coopers, net makers, and all those involved in processing the fish<dfn data-effect="solid" data-for="contents-tooltip" data-tip=" Fish was either smoked on land, or prepared on board and put into barrels, or else sold fresh.">?</dfn> – in a town with a population of around 14,000 at the time. From the 1770s onwards, the value of fish unloaded in the port of Dunkirk exceeded one million livres tournois, having constantly increased since the end of the Seven Years War, with record values in 1781 and 1782. In 1786, the value of fish imported into the Flemish port was estimated at 1.5 million livres tournois, or 8% of the French total; in 1788, it reached 1.9 million, or 13% of the French total. </p><p><Caller id="peche-type-value"></Caller></p><p>Dunkirk was the only French port to commission whalers during the last years of the Ancien Régime: 17 in 1787, and 14 in 1788. The activity was very recent at the time; it had been encouraged in the wake of the American War of Independence, between 1784 and 1786, by Calonne, then Controller General of Finances, and Marshal de Castries, Secretary of State for the Navy, with the state providing around half of the capital required for outfitting the ships. In 1786, Versailles offered a series of privileges to attract whalers from Nantucket in the United States to Dunkirk, and from 1787 onwards their activity generated substantial profits for the outfitters. Between 1786 and 1792, the 79 whaling expeditions, according to Maresquier, and 99, according to Christian Pfister, brought in an average of 1,754,000 livres tournois, that is, 22,200 (Maresquier) or 17,700 (Pfister) livres tournois per expedition. It is impossible to cross-reference these figures with clearances, as these expeditions lasted longer than a year. In 1787, of the 17 departures for whaling or sperm whaling, five were from Nantucket. Using the most conservative average figure, these activities would have generated some 300,000 livres tournois. The national statistics for 1788 put the value of baleen and whale oil taken from the fishery at 710,000 livres tournois.</p><p><Caller id="resume-activite-dunkerquois" year="1787"></Caller></p><p>In addition to fishing, merchants in Dunkirk fitted out several other kinds of ventures. The chart opposite shows the distribution of departures in 1787 by vessel size. The Dunkirk fleet was made up of large ships. The smallest (less than 50 tons) were likely to make several trips a year. In the centre of the image, we can see that the Dunkirk fleet was largely oriented towards international trade, which concerned half of the tonnage from Dunkirk leaving French ports, whether from Dunkirk itself or from the other ports on which we collected data<dfn data-effect="solid" data-for="contents-tooltip" data-tip=" The main gaps in our data for 1787 concern the ports of Provence and Languedoc, and around a third of outbound traffic from the ports of Brittany. Their registers are no longer preserved.">?</dfn>. Some of these departures were linked to fishing: the category "Denmark" included Greenland, a major fishing area; Great Britain included the Shetland Islands (where herring and cod were fished), the ‘maritime zones’ were fishing zones, and Portugal was a supplier of salt, which was necessary for preserving fish. Finally, the right-hand side of the image shows the wide variety of products transported. The data for 1787 are almost complete for all French ports, but for 1789 they include only a small proportion of the departures by Dunkirk ships from other French ports (in addition to departures from Dunkirk, only departures from Poitou, Aunis and Saintonge are shown here).</p><p>Aside from fishing and activities relating to the colonies, there were 184 departures of Dunkirk ships in 1787, totalling just under 14,000 tons. Ships of less than 50 tons were engaged in cabotage between Le Havre and Bruges, carrying colonial goods, fish, and strong spirits. Those of between 40-50 and 80-100 tons extended their range to include the United Provinces, London and, very occasionally, Liverpool. Cereals (wheat, oats, rye) enriched the range of cargoes. From 80-100 tons upwards, Dunkirk ships reached the French Atlantic seaboard (Bordeaux, Bayonne), but sometimes also went to Setubal in Portugal to collect the salt needed for fishing; in this case, they usually left empty. Trade with the Mediterranean (Barcelona, Sète, Marseilles, Genoa, Livorno) was carried out by vessels of 120 tons or more, usually loaded with cereals; this was due to the particular circumstances of those pre-revolutionary years. Only one vessel exceeded 300 tons, the only one from Dunkirk to venture into the Baltic Sea. </p><p>Although Dunkirk’s shipowners invested in various industries, a considerable proportion of the goods traded were carried by foreign shipowners, which broadened the free port’s commercial horizons.</p><h2 id="h.4d34og8">4. The commercial geography of Dunkirk</h2><p><Caller id="carte-destinations" projection="World"></Caller></p><p>The commercial geography of the Flemish port is also based on the transport provided by ships from other French and foreign ports. The following maps show this geography by aggregate tonnage, according to their flag or home port. The first map provides an overview of the destinations of ships that were issued with clearances in Dunkirk in 1789. It shows that shipping from Dunkirk revolved mainly around the North Sea. The colours help to distinguish the players involved in this shipping. The routes to Northern Europe, the Baltic and the United States were almost entirely operated under foreign flags, shown in purple, whereas the destinations where Dunkirk ships prevailed are shown in pink. The journeys made by French ships from other ports, shown in green, were essentially limited to domestic shipping, with very few French vessels travelling abroad from Dunkirk. </p><p><Caller id="carte-destinations" projection="France"></Caller></p><p>Dunkirk’s relations with mainland France show sustained traffic with all the French coasts, which is typical of all the major ports; those of lesser importance focused mainly on their own coastline (English Channel, Atlantic seaboard or Mediterranean). In terms of overall tonnage, the main destinations from Dunkirk were the other major French ports: Bordeaux, Nantes, Rouen and Marennes, the latter being a major supplier of the salt needed for fisheries. Unsurprisingly, Dunkirk ships prevailed in trade with the nearest ports, while they were in the minority at the other French ports on the Channel and Atlantic seaboard. </p><p><Caller id="carte-destinations" montrerdetails="" projection="France"></Caller></p><p>By hovering over the various ports on the map opposite, one obtains the total tonnage shipped from Dunkirk and the share of shipping carried out by the main carrier. We have grouped these dominant carriers into three categories: Dunkirk carriers, other French carriers, and foreign carriers. Departures to Rouen, for example, were largely handled by Dunkerquois (72%), whereas for those to Bordeaux, the majority of traffic was handled by other French flags (59%), with foreigners handling one third and Dunkirk very little (6%). To view these details, click on the port of destination and then hover over the diagram that appears.</p><p>The fact that French shippers were in the majority everywhere on the maritime routes linking Dunkirk to other French ports was due to the legislation in force, which prohibited foreigners from engaging in domestic shipping. Foreign ships leaving Dunkirk could at most go empty-handed to another port in mainland France to load a return cargo. This was the case, for example, for Hamburg and Dutch vessels bound for Bordeaux. The presence of these routes therefore confirms that foreigners came to unload their cargoes in the Flemish free port, with a view to re-exportation (legal or otherwise) or local consumption.</p><p><Caller detailleretrangers="" id="carte-destinations" projection="North Europe"></Caller></p><p>Most of Dunkirk’s European shipping was to the British Isles, the United Provinces and, to a lesser extent, the Scandinavian countries and the Baltic. The dominant flags were generally those of the country of the port of destination. The map shows these, and as you hover over the ports, information about the relative importance of the dominant flag is displayed. For example, to Emden, then a Prussian port, the Prussian flag accounted for 87% of the tonnage leaving Dunkirk. Clicking on a destination gives details of the distribution by flag. For example, towards Ostend, the Imperial flag (Austrian Netherlands) is dominant (38%), but Dunkirk is close behind (34%).</p><p><Caller detailleretrangers="" id="carte-destinations" projection="South Europe"></Caller></p><p>This primacy of foreign shipping was not unique to Dunkirk. Generally, most maritime journeys from French ports on the Atlantic seaboard to destinations not protected by a monopoly (as in the case of colonial trade or national cabotage) were operated by foreign-flagged ships. Only Marseille retained a significant proportion of "active shipping" to international markets in the Mediterranean. Dunkirk itself also carried out a large part of its shipping to Southern Europe, linked to the supply of salt or the resale of its fishing products, but this shipping remained relatively modest compared with the total number of destinations served.</p><p><Caller detailleretrangers="" id="carte-destinations" mintonnage="50" projection="World"></Caller></p><p>This map shows only ships over 50 tons, and excludes the few small English coasters and smugglers. It confirms the highly international nature of the port of Dunkirk, which attracted a wide range of foreign flags. The only French port that was more cosmopolitan was Marseille, with 19 different flags.</p><p>As well as attracting ships from all over Northern Europe and the United States, Dunkirk also fitted out its own ships sailing to Southern Europe, the North Atlantic and, to a lesser extent, the West Indies. We will return to the importance of the Dunkirk warehouse for foreigners, in Section III.</p><p>One of the specific features of Dunkirk was the presence of several hundred English smugglers. The question of the nature of the free port’s maritime trade therefore warrants specific examination, which is conducted in Section II.</p></div>
