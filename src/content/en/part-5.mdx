<div id="part-5"><p>This section presents the reflection that accompanied the decisions regarding the methodology deployed in the case study, in two respects: the identification of smoggleurs among ships leaving French ports (I), and the estimation of the value of smuggled cargoes (II). We also present (III) a visualization tool that can be used to explore the data, but which we did not use in the case study. We limit ourselves here to specifying its composition criteria and providing a brief descriptive analysis.</p><h2 id="h.2p2csry">Spotting smoggleurs</h2><p>Existing literature and contemporary sources attest to smuggling activity from ports other than Dunkirk. We have sought to determine the criteria for identifying smuggler ships from among the clearances delivered at other French ports. </p><p><Caller id="top-ten-gb"></Caller></p><p>It seemed to us that a first possible indicator of the existence of sustained smuggling activity could be the relative importance of departures to Great Britain, compared with total departures. We therefore began by classifying the French ports for which the Navigocorpus database contained data on departures (clearances) for the year 1787, by percentage of destinations to the British Isles (Great Britain, excluding its colonies). We classified the top ten ports by order of importance.  </p><p><Caller id="departs-fr-vers-angleterre"></Caller></p><p>However, this list needs to be reviewed on the basis of other considerations. First, the high percentage of departures to Great Britain is not synonymous with smuggling. For example, all of the 33 clearances from Omonville were intended to supply the Channel Islands with various goods, and this trade was conducted entirely by small French boats. The same was true of Diélette and Port-Bail, although here almost all the trips were made by British ships: the Cherbourg Ferme, on which these three ports depended, confirmed exports of victuals and livestock to England. We should therefore focus on the French ports whence British ships sailed to Britain.</p><p>It is also necessary to consider the possible existence of false declarations in the destinations, and to take into account the nature of the goods transported, which was not always indicated in the documents produced by the Admiralty (the clerk of the Calais Admiralty, for example, did not mention it). The <a className="c11" href="http://vizsources.portic.fr/index.html?source%3Dg5%26year%3D1787%26variable%3Dproducts%26print%3Dfalse%26center%3D%255B48.614281075500145,1.7138673561665212%255D%26zoom%3D7%26world%3Dshorelines">visualisation produced as part of the ANR PORTIC project</a> can be used to explore the presence of the "cargo" variable. When the products are mentioned, they are the two or three main products, with no indication of the quantities. Taking into account exports from all the ports of the corresponding Ferme office can nevertheless help to clarify matters. </p><p>As far as destinations are concerned, we had already easily spotted "Lisbon" and "Bergen" departures from Dunkirk as being false declarations by British smugglers, because we found them three or four days later obtaining another clearance. This was incompatible with a real trip to these distant destinations, which would take weeks. The few real departures for Lisbon from Dunkirk were by large, usually French, ships.</p><p><Caller id="destinations-gb-vers-gb"></Caller></p><p>Among the other dubious destinations, we identified the Faroe Islands (an archipelago under Danish sovereignty at the time), due to the excessive number of departures. We also included North Cape, based on indications in the literature. It is not very present in our database, but we cannot rule out the possibility of real shipping under the British flag from a French port to a Norwegian port; the nature of the goods must therefore also be taken into account. The mention of "ballast" and empty departures are suspicious; the captain could dump his cargo at sea or on a beach with little surveillance before officially entering his port of destination with nothing on board. Passenger traffic also lent itself to smuggling. </p><p><Caller id="smoggleur-statut"></Caller></p><p>Based on the number of departures for British ports, the presence of suspect destinations or goods that British customs did not report, and taking into account the existing literature, we finally selected six French ports likely to supply regular smuggling to the British Isles. We however also excluded six other ports examined: in addition to Omonville, Diélette and Port-Bail, we excluded Calais, Fécamp and Saint-Malo. </p><p>Our filtering criteria for identifying the presence of possible smuggling activity are therefore based on the following variables: British flag (as local smuggling networks require local support); and/or a destination to a British port, or one of the false destinations identified; and/or the nature of the goods known to be smuggled (brandy, gin, tafia, tobacco, tea, and lace). This list comes from the literature and lists kept by the Dunkirk Admiralty detailing smuggled exports. </p><p>As far as possible, we have also sought to confirm that these clues of smuggling are supported by <a className="c11" href="https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C307785">British customs sources</a>, which we have compared with French sources, both for shipping (clearances) and for the quantities of products exported from France (Fermes). This involves both determining the nature of the products exported from France which are not indicated in the British sources, and verifying the under-recording of ship movements between those which the French sources indicate as having left for Great Britain and those which the British sources indicate as having entered their ports. This comparison is complicated by the absence of certain sources and the difficulty of arriving at reliable results, due to the uncertainty that characterizes all these data. The quantitative elements identified remain approximate.</p><p>Here are the steps in our analysis, which first lists the ports we have not selected, then those we have selected.</p><p>For Dieppe, Fécamp, Saint-Malo and the three Cotentin ports: there is nothing in the sources to suggest any significant smuggling. </p><p>For Dieppe: there were 154 clearances issued to British ships out of a total of 745 clearances. The clerk did not indicate the types of products transported. There were four or five ships that made a lot of round trips during the year; might this have been passenger traffic? From the nature of the data exported (Toflit18 database), it does not appear to have been a smuggling port. </p><p>For Fécamp: there were in total 14 departures to Great Britain by vessels flying the British flag. We are excluding this port because the traffic was insignificant and the nature of the exports to Great Britain from the Le Havre office, which includes Fécamp, did not correspond to the products generally smuggled across the Channel. </p><p>For Saint Malo: check made on Toflit18, the same applies; given the benefit of the doubt, only 24 departures of British ships "in ballast" would remain.</p><p>The three Cotentin ports falling under the Cherbourg Ferme (Omonville, Diélette and Port-Bail) have been excluded in view of the nature of the goods transported (victuals and livestock intended for the population of the Channel Islands).</p><p>We have selected five other ports in addition to Dunkirk for our analysis: Calais, Boulogne-sur-Mer, Roscoff, Lorient and Bordeaux. The first three were the busiest ports on the Channel coast. Lorient and Bordeaux were further away, but had a longstanding tradition of trade with the British Isles. For these ports, we determined the filters needed to separate the smoggleurs from British ships engaged in legal trade, taking into account their tonnage and cargo. </p><p><Caller id="smoggleur-proportion"></Caller></p><p>In Calais, the clearances show us regular trans-Channel traffic under the command of a very small group of British captains. John Ratcliff, for example, made 50 crossings in 1787 in command of the 34-ton Princesse from Dover. However, the clearance records do not indicate the nature of the cargo. The arrival of these ships at Dover was also recorded by the British. This was passenger traffic, as confirmed by Inspector Chardon: "In addition, every week, two or three English liners come from Dover to transport passengers again and again from England to France [...] who bring and take away goods". The balance of trade data show exports of very large amounts of brandy and lace from the Calais office to Great Britain in 1789 (approximately 400,000 livres tournois of lace and 238,000 livres tournois of brandy). As this is incompatible with the value of English imports from the whole of France as indicated by <a className="c11" href="https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C307785">British customs sources</a>, we believe that these products were smuggled into England using these passenger boats. We have therefore somewhat arbitrarily identified all British ships of 50 tons or less departing from Calais as likely smugglers. According to this rule, 98% of the trips of British ships would have involved smuggled goods.</p><p>In Boulogne-sur-Mer in 1787, the clerk distinguished between the hundreds of departures for "England" (generic) and the two departures to English ports specifically mentioned by name. We consider the former as smoggleurs. According to this rule, 99% of the voyages of British ships bound for the British Isles were made by smugglers.</p><p>In Roscoff, a smuggling port known through the literature, we have taken as a probable smoggleur any departure for a British port or for a destination likely to have been simulated ("Faroe Islands", "Bergen", "North Cape"), provided that the ship had on board at least one of the following products: brandy, gin, tafia, tobacco, or tea. According to this rule, 77% of the trips of British ships were transporting smuggled goods.</p><p>In Lorient, we have identified as smugglers the British ships declaring that they were leaving for the Faroe Islands, Bergen or "Norway" (generic), all of which were leaving with tobacco, brandy or tea. These ships were unique in that they were almost all Irish. Moreover, their captains sometimes took two clearances on the same day. For instance, on 1 September 1787, the captain of the Saint Patrice from Cork was issued a clearance for "Nord Ferrow in Norway" (Faroe Islands) with 300 sacks of tobacco, even though the day before he had obtained a clearance for Galway, declaring that he was in ballast. Clearly, the captain was first going to unload the smuggled tobacco before officially entering Galway empty. This was not an isolated case. Patt Dwyer did likewise in June 1787, when his Fanny from Limerick left for Bergen with 250 bags of tobacco, and he obtained a clearance in ballast for her home port on the same day. According to this rule, 47% of British ships’ trips were transporting smuggled goods.</p><p>Finally, in Bordeaux, we believe that ships claiming to be going to the Faroe Islands or Bergen and leaving with wine, brandy or tobacco were also smuggling. Here again, these were often Irish ships. According to this rule, 13% of trips by British ships are made by smugglers.</p><h2 id="h.147n2zr">Estimating the value of Dunkirk’s smuggled exports</h2><p><Caller id="prix-smogglage-general"></Caller></p><p>To obtain the estimate of smuggling from the port of Dunkirk in 1787 that we present in the second section of this study, we started from the lists of cargoes exported, available for ten months (gaps: September and November; source: Archives municipales de Dunkerque, 197). These data had already been used by Christian Pfister-Langanay (1985, pp. 350-352) to classify the products, but we wanted to go further, to try to quantify the values involved. </p><p>These lists contain 51 different products. We multiplied the quantities of the 51 types of cargo smuggled over ten months in 1787 with the prices of the same products found in the Toflit18 database, which digitalized the French balance of trade data.</p><p>To determine these prices, we concentrated on French export flows in the 1780s. Where possible, we used the prices of cargoes shipped from Flanders to England, and, failing that, those exported to England from other French ports. In the absence of exports of these goods to England, we used prices for flows to other destinations, which has the advantage of providing a considerably larger number of observations. The number of observations used for our calculations can be viewed by clicking on the selection menu to the right of the graph.</p><p>To determine the average price, we used data from 1787 and, where this was not available, from earlier years. For each product we therefore calculated an average price which was applied to the quantities of cargo smuggled during the course of ten months in 1787, to obtain their value expressed in livres tournois. Two groups of products were exceptions: goods recorded directly in livres tournois/sterling in the original document, and those absent from Toflit18. For the former, we simply kept the values in livres tournois and converted them into sterling; for the latter, such as specific varieties of cotton cloth (i.e. "perses" or "cambray"), we attributed to them the prices of similar products (for these examples, those of fine cotton cloth and cotton canvas).</p><p>This gives a total of 2.75 million livres tournois over the ten months of 1787 for which we have the quantities of products exported. Applying the rule of three, we therefore propose a value of 3.3 million livres tournois for the whole year.</p><h2 id="h.3o7alnk">Monthly navigation from Dunkirk, 1781-1791</h2><p><Caller id="tonnage-moyen-par-mois"></Caller></p><p>The following trend graph shows shipping per month between 1781 and 1791 (with gaps in 1783 and 1784) in aggregate tonnage, based on the registers of clearances issued (congés). </p><p>Analysis of these data shows that maritime activity was highly seasonal from one year to the next (click at the bottom of the diagram to change the year). In general, activity always decreased during the winter. But from one year to the next, the disparities are quite marked and are undoubtedly due to a multiplicity of factors. In <Caller className="is-inblock" debut="1781" fin="1782" id="tonnage-moyen-par-mois">1781-1782</Caller> the war at sea is added to the other elements of variability: weather conditions, nature of the products exported, and types of activity.</p></div>
