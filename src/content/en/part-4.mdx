He consequently wanted this town to become the staple port for all foreign goods necessary for the Kingdom and its manufactures, and to be the channel through which those of his Kingdom would be passed abroad." The good news was that Dunkirk did indeed have a major fishing industry. Disappointingly, however, Dunkirk’s role as a staple port was developed primarily for the introduction into France of industrial products competing with the Kingdom’s factories.</p><p>The Revolution radically changed the situation in Dunkirk. The Admiralty was abolished in August 1791. The Chamber of Commerce was also closed down and its premises taken over by the Commercial Court. The universally hated Ferme Générale was dismantled between October 1790 and May 1791, and the free port was definitively suppressed on 31 December 1794, after which customs were finally properly installed in Dunkirk. The privileges of Dunkirk’s seafarers disappeared with the establishment of a truly national maritime registry, which in Dunkirk took place at the end of November 1791.</p><p>After the Revolution and the Napoleonic wars, the foundations of Dunkirk’s economy changed radically. The loss of Saint-Domingue put an end to the colonial prosperity from which Dunkirk had also benefited, a long century of peace destroyed the predatory economy linked to privateering, which was abolished, and the rise of the English economy and its liberal policies rendered smuggling futile. The end of the free port offered far fewer opportunities for fraud. All that remained for the people of Dunkirk was to return to the traditional activities of fishing and cabotage.</p></div>
