Attached to the Spanish crown, it developed privateering on a large scale under Philip II (1555-1598), in addition to its traditional fishing and trading activities. Capturing enemy merchant ships in wartime was a highly profitable business, and from the 1580s Flemish sailors made it their speciality.</p><p><Caller id="intro" step="2"></Caller></p><p>In 1662 Dunkirk was bought by the Kingdom of France, then under Louis XIV who initially saw it as a strategic post on the English Channel for privateering activities<dfn data-effect="solid" data-for="contents-tooltip" data-tip=" Privateering was a predatory activity whereby a private individual, with the authorization of the state of which they were a subject, obtained permission to seize the merchant or fishing vessels of an enemy country on the open sea. Thus, unlike piracy, this was a legal activity. Part of the profits from privateering went to the privateer’s state.">?</dfn> against his English and Dutch enemies. However, over time the importance of privateering diminished as trade became more and more diversified, despite Dunkirk’s shipowners playing a modest role in the colonial turn that characterized French trade in the Age of Enlightenment. In 1789, Dunkirk’s involvement in transatlantic trade was ten times less than that of Bordeaux, and four or five times less than that of Nantes, Le Havre or Marseille, in terms of both the number of maritime shipments and the value of colonial goods imported and re-exported (see Section III). On the other hand, Dunkirk was one of France’s main fishing ports; it traded intensively with other French and European ports, and English smugglers made around a hundred cross-Channel trips a month.</p><p><Caller id="intro" step="3"></Caller></p><p>It is difficult to quantify this traffic and the value of Dunkirk’s trade. From 1662, the town had a privileged status that placed it outside the kingdom’s customs borders. It was therefore largely exempt from the control exercised over trade flows by the state through the Ferme Générale, to which the sovereign entrusted the collection of taxes on imports and exports. It was, in the words of the time, a free port "like an actual foreign country" ("à l’instar de l’étranger effectif").</p><p><Caller id="intro" step="4"></Caller></p><p>This privilege, along with the port’s unique geographical position, had a decisive influence on its maritime economy during the Enlightenment era. To study this economy, we have two different but complementary types of data: data on shipping in the port of Dunkirk from the Navigocorpus project; and trade statistics from the Toflit18 project, which, although very incomplete, offer a useful counterpoint to the former. </p><p>First, we will detail the institutional and fiscal aspects of the port of Dunkirk’s operations at that time, and present an overview of its maritime activities. We will then look more specifically at the major smuggling operations that took place with England, which was not only the sworn enemy of the Kingdom of France during what was known as the "Second Hundred Years War", but also the other major European economy at the time. Lastly, we will look at the nature of Dunkirk as a staple port. Did it simply serve as a base for smuggling goods into France, or was it really an intermediary between the various European markets?</p></div>
