<div id="part-3"><h2 id="h.44sinio">1. The question</h2><p>Throughout the 18th century, Dunkirk was suspected of taking advantage of its duty-free status to bring goods into France without paying duties. Its accusers were the Ferme (which lost customs revenue) and merchants from other ports in the kingdom (who suffered from unfair competition). In the 1760s, the author of a tendentious text – allegedly an English merchant – was delighted that Dunkirk was smuggling British goods into France.<dfn data-effect="solid" data-for="contents-tooltip" data-tip=" Archives of the Dunkirk Chamber of Commerce, secret register, f 78 verso-f 82 recto and duplicate in English f 75-77, meeting of 2 January 1764.">?</dfn> During debates on the future of the Dunkirk franchise at the National Assembly on 31 October 1790, the deputy Bouchette, who was elected for the Nord département, gave a colourful description of the various cases of fraud of which he accused the merchants of Dunkirk (see our summary in French of the <a className="c23" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xlLWOiW-Dd-nvkFKFsSlnfQBke_4ekbw/edit">National Assembly Debate of 31 October 1790</a>).</p><p><Caller id="annexe-an-1790"></Caller></p><p>In 1789, a "statistical" event took place that allowed us to assess the validity of these complaints. Since at least 1762, the Bureau de la Balance du Commerce (balance of trade office) had been collecting aggregate data on Dunkirk’s trade, although the scope of the data is not very clear. The statistics that have come down to us for the period between 1762 and 1780 (with some years missing) describe a fairly mediocre trade: an average of 1.1 million livres tournois in exports and 4 million in imports (TOFLIT18).</p><p>The figures for 1789 are completely different: the free port, excluding subordinate offices, exported 6 million livres tournois worth of goods (1.5 million to the colonies and 4.5 million in colonial re-exports to the rest of the world – outside of mainland France) and imported to a value of 43 million. Trade from subordinate offices<dfn data-effect="solid" data-for="contents-tooltip" data-tip=" These were offices of lesser importance than that of Dunkirk itself, but located in the vicinity of the free port. The sources we use mention «Subordonnés de Dunkerque» and «Dunkerque-Basseville». ">?</dfn> (including with the free port of Dunkirk) amounted to 2 million in exports and 15 million in imports. The sources do not mention any other exports from the free port. However, we can measure the exports to the rest of France by looking at the value of imports that the other Ferme offices (including Dunkirk’s subordinate offices) noted as coming from Dunkirk: 4 million livres tournois. We have not found any sources mentioning non-colonial exports to the rest of Europe and the United States.</p><p>Two conclusions can be drawn: first, the scope of the trade measured between 1762 and 1780 is not the same as that of the trade measured in 1789. In 1789, the Ferme obtained from the Admiralty the means to evaluate Dunkirk’s imports following the discussions after the signing of the trade treaty with England. Second, the figures for 1789 (but not those for 1762-1780) easily explain the suspicions of smuggling at the free port: whereas 43 million livres tournois entered Dunkirk, only 9 million livres tournois (including the 3 million livres tournois of smuggled goods calculated above) left it. What happened to the remaining 34 million livres tournois of goods? Some of them could have been used for the port’s own consumption, but a population of 27,000 could not have consumed 1,370 livres tournois of imported goods per capita (the average income in France at the time was around 200 livres tournois per year). Dunkirk claimed that the 34 million livres tournois of goods were exported to the rest of Europe, which would make Dunkirk a staple port. Opponents claimed that they were exported clandestinely to the rest of France, which would make Dunkirk a smuggling port.</p><p><Caller id="fraude-exports-dunkerque"></Caller></p><p>This suspicion of fraud can be illustrated by examining Dunkirk’s trade in colonial goods. The city imported goods worth just over 8 million livres tournois from the French colonies, and it re-exported only 4 million livres tournois worth of goods. The graph opposite shows that more than two-thirds of the coffee and almost a third of the sugar and cotton appears to have disappeared. It is understandable that the port’s rivals would have suspected that the remaining 4 million were being smuggled into the Kingdom. </p><h2 id="h.2jxsxqh">2. Method and sources</h2><p>We can assess the validity of the suspicions of fraud if we investigate what happened to Dunkirk’s apparent trade deficit of 34 million livres tournois, by cross-referencing navigation sources in Navigocorpus and trade sources in Toflit18. Navigocorpus provides data on shipping from Dunkirk to other countries, and we can use these figures to estimate the value of Dunkirk’s exports abroad. This can then be compared with the 34 million livres tournois. If Dunkirk exported only a few million livres tournois of goods abroad, the suspicions of fraud would be confirmed. If it exported several tens of millions of livres tournois of goods abroad, they would be weakened.</p><p>Thus, apart from smuggling to England, the clearance registers show the departure of ships totalling 18,140 tons (excluding destinations in France and its colonies and the slave trade; excluding fishing activities; and excluding departures in ballast or empty). To estimate the value, we use our knowledge of French trade in 1787. In that year, a "Tableau de la Navigation" (navigation table) in the Archives Nationales (AN F12/1835, Table 2) provides us with the total tonnage used by French exports, by partner. For convenience, we refer to this document as "source F12", in contrast to the local navigation sources in the rest of this document. A "General Summary" in the same archive (AN F12/251) also shows French exports by partner, both by land and by sea. To estimate the proportion of exports by sea, we have used a later document ("Tableau estimatif du commerce"), covering the year 1792, which indicates the proportions shipped by land and by sea (AN F12/252 and AN F12/1834B). </p><p>We estimate an export value per partner for Dunkirk based on the following formula:</p><p><Caller id="formule-estimation"></Caller></p><p>where t is the tonnage, v is the export value, and r is the share of trade by sea.</p><p>It is not feasible to expect that this method, which combines sources from several years and covering different geographical areas, will give a precisely accurate value. However, it does provide an order of magnitude. That is more than we have had so far. </p><h3 id="h.z337ya">Estimate of t(1787, France, Partner P)</h3><p>We use "source F12" to estimate outbound shipping by partner in 1787. This source is not perfect. First, it is ambiguous as to whether ships in ballast are included in its first table or not. This table gives a total of outgoing tonnages (for England, 87,563 tons) whereas another table, a few pages later, shows 39,517 tons in ballast. After some thought and comparison with the Navigocorpus data, we believe that shipping in ballast is not included in the first table. We nevertheless present the results of both hypotheses in the graphs opposite (assuming that the tonnages in the first table include departures in ballast, the tonnages that would have left for England would be only 87,563 - 39,517 tx, i.e. 38,046 tx). </p><p><Caller id="tonnages-1787-f12"></Caller></p><p>Second, the total tonnages from the "F12 source" are quite different from the data collected by the Navigocorpus programme from local clearance registers. The difference is fairly easy to explain for Mediterranean destinations (Italy, the Levant, Barbary, etc.), as Navigocorpus was unable to digitize ship departures from Provence and Languedoc, where the clearance registers were not preserved. This hardly affects our survey of Dunkirk. The data for Holland, the Hanseatic towns and the Baltic are also not cause for concern; they are very similar between Navigocorpus and the "F12 source". On the other hand, it is more difficult to reconcile departures for England. Navigocorpus gives total departures of 140,000 tonneaux (plus 15,000 tx in ballast). The "F12 source" gives (rounding off) only 90,000 tonneaux and reports 40,000 tonneaux in ballast.<dfn data-effect="solid" data-for="contents-tooltip" data-tip=" This has led us to assume that the data in the first columns of the «F12 source» do not include ships in ballast (and that the 40,000 txare therefore not included in the 90,000 tx). ">?</dfn> In this case, while the total tonnages are comparable (155,000 vs 130,000), the tonnages excluding ballast are less so (140,000 vs 90,000). The Navigo figures are therefore two-thirds higher. If we were to favour them, this would reduce our estimate of exports from Dunkirk to the British Isles by 40%, reducing the estimated value per ton by the same amount. We give preference to the national source because our export figures are also national. If part of the shipping eluded the national administration, it is plausible that the exports corresponding to that shipping would also have eluded it. In that case, the amount of exports per ton of interest to us here would not be too biased.</p><h3 id="h.3j2qqm3">Estimate of v(1787, France, PartnerP)</h3><p>This estimate does not pose any difficulty by using the "Résumé général de la valeur totale du Commerce...". (F12/251). In F12/250 there is even a second source, which is based on the format of earlier trade data ("Objet Général du Commerce..."), and essentially concordant.</p><p><Caller id="exports-fr-1787"></Caller></p><h3 id="h.1y810tw">Estimate of r(1792, France, PartnerP)</h3><p>We wanted to subtract from our calculations of the value of exports the share of foreign trade that was carried out by land. Document F12/252 gives the share of trade by land and sea for each of France’s trading partners in 1792. Most trade was by sea. However, this was not the case for "Germany &amp; Poland" (100% of exports by land). In fact, trade by sea with Germany was recorded as being to "Prussia" or the "Hanseatic Cities" (a category which also included Danzig). Logically, transport by land accounted for 100% of exports to Switzerland, 82% of exports to Spain (which seems high), 48% to the States of the Kingdom of Sardinia, and 65% to the Emperor’s States (in this case, essentially, trade with Austrian Flanders). The figure for overland trade with the Emperor’s States is probably an overestimate of what it should have been in 1789 because of the war that broke out on 20 April 1792. We have not attempted to correct this overestimate; to do so would reduce the estimate of exports from Dunkirk to Flanders, since it would reduce the value exported per ton.</p><h2 id="h.4i7ojhp">3. Results</h2><p>Cross-referencing the F12 source with the Résumé général de la valeur totale du Commerce (General Summary of the Total Value of Trade) (F12/251) gives the following results, which express the value of an average ton exported to each of the trading partners. The value of a ton exported to England (in fact, to the British Isles) is probably a little low (and would be even lower if we rely on Navigocorpus data), while that of a barrel exported to Flanders is a little high. None of these figures seem improbable.</p><p><Caller id="valeur-par-tonneau"></Caller></p><p>Without close analysis, it is difficult to explain the differences in the value of tonnage exported to various partners. We could explore the composition of exports in relation to the trading partners, but there is no guarantee that this would yield reliable results. In any case, mixing different sources leads to large margins of error on the values per ton. </p><h3 id="h.2xcytpi">3.1 Test on the direction<dfn data-effect="solid" data-for="contents-tooltip" data-tip=" The Ferme Générale consisted of several directions across France, was and each direction had several offices (bureaux).">?</dfn> of the La Rochelle Ferme</h3><p>Before looking at the results for Dunkirk, we tested the method for a direction of the Fermes for which we have both export values by partner and export tonnages (excluding ballast) by partner: La Rochelle (see our previous work on <a className="c23" href="https://medialab.github.io/portic-storymaps-2021/fr/">La Rochelle</a>). This direction includes all the ports between and including Noirmoutier and Mortagne. </p><p><Caller id="comparaisons-la-rochelle"></Caller></p><p>The results of the estimation (15 M) are fairly close to the reality described by Toflit18 (11.5 M): the over-estimate is just under a third. The direction of La Rochelle is of course particular in that a large part of the tonnage shipped was salt, which was worth less than the rest of the French trade. The result therefore seems rather encouraging to us, insofar as we are looking for an order of magnitude.</p><h3 id="h.1ci93xb">3.2. Projection on Dunkirk 1789</h3><p>For the estimation of the value of exports in the Dunkirk case, we are not taking into account the smoggleurs, which have already been dealt with in Section II. This leaves us with 266 journeys by non-empty ships bound for destinations that are neither fishing, nor within France or its colonies. These 266 journeys total 18,148 tons (i.e. 70 tons for each departure). Their destination is shown in this graph, according to the aggregated categories of partners provided by the national sources. </p><p><Caller id="destinations-dk-pour-projection"></Caller></p><p>From this tonnage, broken down by destination partner, we have estimated the value of exports in 1789 by destination, by attributing the value of an exported ton in 1787 as calculated above.</p><p><Caller id="estimation-par-destination-dk"></Caller></p><p>We can therefore estimate the value of exports from Dunkirk to other countries at nine million livres tournois. The projection logically gives a very important place to Flanders, partly because of the high value per ton, followed by Holland and England. The other destinations for ships leaving Dunkirk are more or less equivalent. Denmark, Portugal, Prussia and the United States are less important in terms of value than in terms of their share of shipping. </p><p><Caller id="comparaison-projection-destination-produits-coloniaux-dk"></Caller></p><h3 id="h.3whwml4">Final accounts</h3><p>It is therefore possible to draw up a balance sheet of Dunkirk’s imports (provided by sources) and exports (indicated by sources or estimated). As a reminder: </p><p>1. Imports indicated by source: </p><ul><li>1.a. Imports from the colonies, from ANOM F2/B/14</li><li>1.b. Imports from other countries, from F12/1667</li><li>1.c. Exports to Dunkirk from other French ports, from F12/1666</li></ul><p>2. Exports indicated by source: </p><ul><li>2.a. Dunkirk’s imports from other French ports, from F12/1667</li><li>2.b. Colonial re-exports, from ANOM F2/B/14</li><li>2.c. Exports to the colonies, from ANOM F2/B/14</li></ul><p>3. Estimated exports</p><ul><li>3.a. Smuggling using the estimate described in Section II</li><li>3.b. Exports (France and the colonies excluded), including colonial re-exports, from the estimate in this section.</li></ul><p>This calculation shows that the total value of exports is 27 million livres tournois less than that of imports. Irrespective of the uncertainties of the estimate, this is a significant figure: 62% of imports appear to have been smuggled into the Kingdom. That is 8 times more than the value of smuggling to England.</p><p><Caller id="estimation-imports-exports"></Caller></p><p>If we cross-reference our sources with those of the British "Inspector General’s Accounts of Imports and Exports" (CUST), it is interesting to note that our estimates of legal exports from Dunkirk to England (1.8 M) are not very different from England’s declarations of imports from French Flanders (2.2 M). However, the French values are not directly comparable with the British ones, because the British statistics were based on prices set several decades prior to that, whereas the French ones were frequently updated.</p><h2 id="h.2bn6wsx">4. Was Dunkirk an exceptional port for smuggling? </h2><p><Caller id="imports-dunkerque-vs-ports-francs"></Caller></p><p>If we compare the composition of Dunkirk’s imports with those of all the other free ports (Bayonne, Lorient and Marseille, which can also be selected individually from the menu at the top of the right-hand column), we find in 1789 (with the exception of Lorient) the importance of wheat, which was cruelly lacking in France that year. Bayonne imported mainly colonial goods and wine. Marseille imported oils for its industrial needs, as well as woollen fabrics and colonial products. Wheat, colonial products and manufactured goods were important for Bayonne, Dunkirk and Marseille. Lorient also imported manufactured goods (hardware) and colonial goods (tobacco), but no wheat, probably because it had no hinterland to supply. Its import values were moreover very low. </p><p><Caller id="estimation-exports-dk-snail"></Caller></p><p>These specializations are therefore only slightly different. However, when it comes to smuggling there are major differences, as the snail charts show.</p><p><Caller id="fraude-exports-ports-francs" showports="Marseille,Bayonne"></Caller></p><p>We apply the same method to Bayonne and Marseille (without having to make projections). We find 7 million "missing" exports in Bayonne (for total imports of 15 million). These figures are lower, both in value and in proportion, than those found for Dunkirk. For Marseille, taking into account the fact that the missing exports of raw and agricultural materials are partly explained by their transformation into manufactured products in a large industrial city, we find 23 million in potential smuggling, for 163 million in imports. This is proportionately much less than Dunkirk. Moreover, some of this 23 million was not fraud because it was partly absorbed by consumption in Marseille, a city with a population of over 100,000.</p><p>Dunkirk’s reputation as a smuggling port is therefore well-founded. Its activity as a staple port between the British Isles and the rest of Europe was secondary to its role as a clandestine gateway to the French market. The merchants who frequented Dunkirk were hardly more honest in their dealings with the French authorities than they were with the British authorities. </p></div>
