<div id="part-6"><p>This website has been produced as part of the <a className="c10" href="https://anr.portic.fr/">ANR PORTIC research programme</a>. This programme focuses on the dynamics of navigation and foreign trade in the eighteenth century, a trade largely conducted by sea. In addition to gaining a better understanding of these dynamics by cross-referencing two sets of data (navigation and trade), one of the fundamental challenges of the programme is to find methods of qualifying and understanding the uncertainty of historical data, by experimenting with appropriate modes of visualisation and writing.</p><p>Within this framework, Working Package 5 of this research programme consists of carrying out a series of case studies drawing on two existing bodies of digitised historical sources: <a className="c10" href="http://navigocorpus.org/">Navigocorpus</a>, a database on the history of navigation, piloted by Silvia Marzagalli and Christine Plumejeaud; and <a className="c10" href="http://toflit18.medialab.sciences-po.fr/%23/home">Toflit18</a>, a database on French foreign trade, piloted by Loïc Charles and Guillaume Daudin. As such, this case study is part of a triptych composed with two other surveys published in web format:</p><ul><li><a className="c10" href="https://medialab.github.io/portic-storymaps-2021">Multiscale trade in eighteenth-century La Rochelle region</a></li><li><a className="c10" href="https://medialab.github.io/portic-storymaps-2023">Prosperity and resilience of the port of Marseille in the eighteenth century</a></li></ul><p>The aim of these projects is to make the most of the work already carried out during the initial digitisation projects for each of the two databases (Navigocorpus and Toflit18), through the in-depth study of significant subsets of the data. These studies shed new light on existing disciplinary questions thanks to the new materials and methods offered by the databases mobilised by the programme. The questions raised by such an initiative are manifold:</p><ul><li>How can we bring together two sources, some of whose dimensions are incommensurable or difficult to equate? How can the digitised data from the two databases be cross-referenced with more detailed and qualitative knowledge of the phenomena under study, provided by historians specialising in the region under study?</li><li>How can we take into account, at the time of investigation and reasoning, the significant stratification of transformations, reductions and interpretative decisions that make up the chain of documentary operations linking the initial sources with the data derived from them?</li><li>How can the uncertainty or incompleteness of the data be taken into account while still offering a scientifically sound analysis of the phenomena studied?</li><li>How can the classic forms of historical writing - the narrative unfolded sentence by sentence, the argument unfolded paragraph by paragraph - be brought into dialogue with the diagrammatic and computational forms of writing involved in composing a website?</li><li>How can we manage the interdisciplinary collaboration and partition of expertise that such multimodal writing involves?</li></ul><p>All these questions were addressed during the collaborative process that led to the creation of this site, and here is a brief account for the purposes of documentation and modest practical and methodological feedback for other similar research.</p><h2 id="h.dru36nbx6gy9">From a series of questions to a week of investigation</h2><p>The case study of which this site is the culmination was built around an intensive collaborative format that we call a datasprint<dfn data-effect="solid" data-for="contents-tooltip" data-tip=' Venturini, Tommaso, Anders Munk, and Axel Meunier. "Data-sprinting: A public approach to digital research." Routledge handbook of interdisciplinary research methods. Routledge, 2018. 158-163.'>?</dfn>, which involves experts from several disciplines working together over a short period of time and with research questions determined in advance, on the basis of one or more datasets prepared for the occasion.</p><p>Prior to the datasprint, we spent several months preparing both the data and the research questions.</p><p>As far as the data was concerned, the Navigocorpus and Toflit18 teams were able to benefit from the extensive work of cleaning and refining the data pertaining to areas and periods studied, which had already been carried out as part of the datasprint on the La Rochelle region. New data held in the French and British National Archives was also entered and checked to address specific questions, particularly relating to smuggling. Finally, we were able to take advantage of the long-term archival work of historian Christian Pfister, who took part in this case study and the associated datasprint, by taking up the surveys and calculations documented in his publications<dfn data-effect="solid" data-for="contents-tooltip" data-tip=" Pfister-Langanay, Christian. Ports, navires et négociants à Dunkerque, 1662-1792. (1985).">?</dfn> and personal documentation, and harmonising them technically with the other data.</p><p><Caller className="is-invalid" id="about-modeles"></Caller></p><p>In terms of preparing the research questions, we conducted a series of preliminary meetings linked by online documents written collaboratively, which helped us to identify questions that were relevant in terms of the history of Dunkirk and the existing literature, but also compatible with what the data allowed us to explore and visualise. This work of adjusting and matching questions and data ran from October 2021 to April 2022, and enabled us both to identify the most relevant exploration activities to propose to participants during the workshop, and to avoid the pitfalls that would have led us into unanswerable questions.</p><p><Caller className="is-invalid" id="modules-recherche"></Caller></p><p>The week of intensive collaboration was thus prepared to be structured around modules or lines of enquiry, each combining: the historical and economic questions to be explored, the relevant bibliography for these questions, technical guidelines on the data to be considered in the databases, and the beginnings of questions that could be worked on through data analysis and visualisation with the engineers and designers mobilised for the datasprint. The video above gives a quick overview of the format of these preparatory documents.</p><p><Caller className="is-invalid" id="viz-preparatoires-christine"></Caller></p><p>Preliminary enquiries and tools were also developed to maximise the value of the time spent working together on the datasprint. Christine Plumejeaud carried out a major mapping and enrichment project on data relating to navigation to the UK (above), and Guillaume Brioudes, a developer who was then doing an internship at Sciences Po's médialab, developed an exploration application tailored to the needs and corpus of the datasprint, enabling a series of effective visualisations to be generated on the fly, making it possible to understand the distribution and content of navigocorpus data about Dunkirk (below). This <a className="c10" href="https://medialab.github.io/navigo-datasprint-explorer/">small application</a>, whose <a className="c10" href="https://github.com/medialab/navigo-datasprint-explorer">source code</a> is open like all PORTIC outputs, could be re-used for other research.</p><p><Caller className="is-invalid" id="datasprint-explorer"></Caller></p><p>The datasprint week took place in March 2022 on the premises of the Sciences Po médialab, 1 place Saint-Thomas d'Aquin in Paris, during the fragile period of recovery from the COVID 19 epidemic. We had the medialab's meeting and group work room at our disposal, as well as a series of office rooms where we could divide up into small working groups.</p><p>The working week was organised around a spatial and digital infrastructure based on the enquiry modules developed in preparation for the working week. Spatially, the workplace was organised around a large common display area, placed on one of the walls of the main room, which we used to divide up the tasks to be carried out and to passively share the results being produced. The organisation of this display surface was initially conceived as a space supporting a Kanban methodology, i.e. organised in three columns 'to do', 'in progress', and 'done'. However, from the very first day, each space on the wall was eventually dedicated to one of the 'investigation modules' defined before the datasprint, and the people who worked on each of these modules started to add visualisations, post-its analysing or warning about points to be noted in relation to the data, sketches of visualisations to be carried out, etc. Around this shared display surface, different groups of 2 to 5 people, always mixed in terms of the skills brought in, were formed and spread across all the rooms and spaces available in the Sciences Po médialab premises.</p><p>On the digital side, the enquiry group was structured around the use of a shared Google Drive folder, organised into folders corresponding to the survey modules, and a source code repository on the github platform, used by everyone who knew how to program to share scripts and useful reusable data files, such as specific categorisations of ports or products.</p><p><Caller className="is-invalid" id="datasprint-infrastructure"></Caller></p><p>In addition to the various 'silo' working groups organised around each research module and the interactions around the main wall, we have regularly organised (sometimes very short) plenary sessions to share progress and pool knowledge or technical developments, enabling the different groups to help each other. We have also regularly ensured that people with expertise in the history of Dunkirk (in particular the historian Christian Pfister), databases (Christine Plumejeaud, Silvia Marzagalli, Loïc Charles, Guillaume Daudin) or the general management of the datasprint (Robin de Mourat), regularly leave their working group to take part in discussions in all the other groups, in order to facilitate the sharing of information and the coordination of the datasprint.</p><p><Caller className="is-invalid" id="datasprint-programme"></Caller></p><p>The first part of the datasprint was devoted to exploring the questions set out in the initial lines of enquiry, while the second part was more concerned with finalising the visualisations and developing an argumentative plan for the history of Dunkirk in the eighteenth century, to be presented in the original format of PORTIC web publications, combining text and interactive images.</p><p><Caller className="is-invalid" id="photos-datasprint"></Caller></p><p>The datasprint ended with a plenary session at which all the results were presented and discussed. The degree of completion of the enquiries enabled the historians and economists to finish the datasprint with a temporary outline for writing the web publication. However, only two of the three sections of this outline had been covered by the data work carried out during the week. The third and final section, dealing with the hypothesis that Dunkirk had abused its franchise to bring goods into France without paying duties, was based on the observation of suspicious imbalances in the port's balance of imports and exports as calculated during the workshop week. The insatiable appetite for discovery and the contagious excitement of economists and historians about a possible scientific breakthrough that would have contributed significantly to the existing bibliography were enough to convince all the members of the collective that this last part of the publication should be developed in the months following the datasprint.</p><p><Caller className="is-invalid" id="video-pleniere"></Caller></p><p>One of the advantages of the datasprint format is that it encourages a unity of time for interdisciplinary work. In most cases, datasprints, as invented at médialab, are both a time for exploration and a time for producing imperfect and temporary results, which are intended to feed into subsequent collaborations on other projects with a longer timeframe. The documentary traces of datasprints have often been more in the form of exploration reports than finalised publications. However, in our case, this principle came up against the need to ensure that the PORTIC datasprints resulted in finished products that could be consulted as such in educational or even scientific contexts. The difficulty and length of this process (from start to finish, more than two years to completion) had not been anticipated by any of the parties involved in the research project.</p><h2 id="h.j4a1zq1sl2ja">Continuing the long-term investigation, with a view to building a strong case and making a significant contribution to the state of the art</h2><p>On the basis of the work carried out during the datasprint, we embarked on a second phase of deepening, verifying and consolidating the results. In terms of content, the lines of research initially envisaged were gradually reworked. This was done at the end of the datasprint week, when a summary document was drawn up comparing the visualisations produced during the week. This work was then continued by Guillaume Brioudes, who carried out crucial documentation and synthesis work on the week's productions.</p><p>Based on the stocktaking work carried out after the datasprint, we realised that the final part of the planned publication would require us to continue in depth a series of lines of enquiry, and in particular the methodology for estimating Dunkirk's real trade, which is at the heart of the third part of this publication.</p><p>To this end, we organised a second intensive workshop with Paul Girard, Robin de Mourat, Maxime Zoffoli, Guillaume Brioudes and Christine Plumejeaud, specifically focused on the continuation of the enquiries and the prefiguration of some of the final visualisations. The complexity of manipulating data from a number of heterogeneous sources in order to estimate Dunkirk's trade, combined with the multiplicity and disciplinary heterogeneity of the knowledge and skills to be mobilised for this purpose, was addressed through the production of multiple visualisations and the conduct of multiple explorations and verifications using Jupyter notebooks. This work, which began during the second datasprint, then continued for more than another year of low-intensity work on the data and the various verifications that were needed to stabilise the observations and their conclusions, presented in the third part. As the work progressed, we encountered numerous twists and turns in the conclusions to be drawn from the case study, since the results of the calculations were several times drastically transformed by the identification of errors as varied as: correspondence errors in the different names of the geopolitical entities in the sources, differences in the units of measurement, subtleties in the filters to be carried out on the different sources, and so on.</p><p><Caller className="is-invalid" id="making-of-alignement-tonneaux"></Caller></p><p>In terms of information design, the post-sprint period was also an opportunity for designers Maxime Zoffoli and Robin de Mourat to explore more qualitative ways of using the experimental web publication format and the interactive diagrams it allows to feature. For example, the work on the history of Dunkirk led to the creation of an interactive timeline showing the evolution of the port's borders and cartography, while the work on piloting provided an opportunity to work on the visual explanation of a calculation and estimation methodology. These experiments were also combined with more technical work on the production of ‘responsive’ visualisations, which vary in form depending on whether they are consulted on a mobile or computer screen, and according to a variety of configurations and screen sizes.</p><p><Caller className="is-invalid" id="frise-maxime"></Caller></p><h2 id="h.fxih2baprl8o">The making of a website as a pivotal point for interdisciplinary collaboration</h2><p>In order to draw up a document suitable for publication and to convey a narrative and arguments based on the data from the two databases, we tried to use the perspective of building a website to articulate three types of 'writing': the creation of new data files corresponding to the enquiries raised by the week's activities (computational writing); the creation of information visualisations (diagrammatic writing); and finally, of course, the putting into narrative and historical argument of the case study (prose writing).</p><p>As part of this, we set up a working infrastructure aimed at gradually developing this website while its textual and graphic 'content' was still being worked on. The website under construction thus served both as an objective and as a means of bringing together the various activities that followed the week-long datasprint workshop.</p><p>The creation of the site presented to the public was based on an automated protocol that enabled the site to be updated daily during its writing and development phase, and thus to jointly advance its structure, its graphic appearance and the various contents that populate it (see its <a className="c10" href="https://github.com/medialab/portic-storymaps-2022">github repository</a> for more information). More specifically, this automated protocol consisted in retrieving the content written in a google documents written by the historians, the data from the Navigocorpus and Toflit18 databases on their respective digital spaces, and finally in producing a set of data optimised for the web before remaking the site.</p><p><Caller className="is-invalid" id="processus-maj-automatique"></Caller></p><p>This "sur mesure" working method has enabled us to go through many iterations on the data, visualisations and texts, in order to gradually develop a document that is coherent for reading. It also enabled us to avoid an approach that would have us format the production of the site too sequentially, i.e. following an initial 'design' phase and then a second 'execution' phase, instead making room for discovery and dialogue with the different materials being developed. It allowed the relationships between the different types of writing to be worked on progressively, for example by testing the relationship between text and images using paper sketches directly integrated into the site to allow the historians and economists to project themselves into the final result while the final visualisations were being developed.</p><p><Caller className="is-invalid" id="croquis-visualisations"></Caller></p><p>Therefore, the method of working and assembling the site adopted here, in addition to the dimension of optimisation implied by the automation of certain tasks, was envisaged as a means of encouraging a more organic dialogue between the different forms of writing involved in this document: by simultaneously designing the site, the visualisations and the accompanying texts, we have tried to ensure that each of these activities benefits from the other, as sources of invention or mutual reinforcement, rather than considering them as specialised tasks and/or articulated according to a system of subordination (from history to technique, or from the visual to the textual, or from the argument to its illustration, etc.). ). In practice, this ambition has been applied in varying ways to different parts of the publication. It worked well for the first chapter, in which the visualisations of the history of the port interact very closely with the related text; it worked less well for the second part, which is guided above all by the text and in which the visualisations play a relatively minor illustrative role; the third part, which shows the historical and economic reasoning in progress, has a special status in that it retains many of the traces of the multiple 'notebooks' that were needed to put it together, and offers a variety of ways in which the visualisations can interact with the text.</p><h2 id="h.ub5q8dkj8ap1">A document designed to weave links with other activities and other audiences</h2><p>This web document is intended as an autonomous object, unfolding the scientific story of the history of Dunkirk in the eighteenth century, but also as the starting point for scientific and didactic assemblages yet to come. In order to qualify the register of writing and the degree of complexity that we would allow ourselves, we agreed to produce it with the idea of addressing it to an 'intermediate' audience (neither that of a 'general public', which is always elusive, nor that of 'peers' with whom we interact via other types of document such as journal articles), i.e. an audience made up of history students, teachers and students of the history of Dunkirk. This audience is made up of history students, secondary school history teachers and advanced amateurs with a passion for Old Regime trade and shipping or smuggling. However, the site is also designed to appeal to two complementary audiences:</p><ul><li>people specialising in the mediation and/or popularisation of history and economics, who will be able to use some of the visualisations presented here for initiatives aimed at a wider audience;</li><li>specialist historians and economists, who will be able to cite these visualisations in conventional publications in journals or monographs, and thus draw on them to continue our investigations or make them work in a more advanced way.</li></ul><p>To do this, we've made each of the visualisations 'detachable' from the story on the Atlas page - and, more technically, given each visualisation its own URL.</p><p>In addition, the <a className="c10" href="https://github.com/medialab/portic-storymaps-2022">site's source code</a>, shared under an open licence, has been built and documented in such a way that it can be derived - in whole or in part - for other future projects. Finally, it should be noted that all the data used - and the scripts that generate them from the complete Toflit18 and Navigocorpus data, both freely accessible - are also included in the site's source code, making our visualisations and results entirely reproducible.</p><h2 id="h.bm38bbekxtmz">Credits</h2><p>This website is the result of a collective investigation and writing process involving people from a number of disciplines: history, economics, computer sciences, geomatics and design.</p><p>The texts in this publication were written by Silvia Marzagalli (professor of modern history, Université Côte d'Azur - CMMC, coordinator and scientific co-director of the PORTIC programme), Guillaume Daudin (professor of economics, Université Paris-Dauphine - LEDa-DIAL), Christian Pfister (HDR lecturer, Université du Littoral) and Pierre Niccolo' Sofia (post-doctoral fellow in the PORTIC programme, Université Côte d'Azur - CMMC).
